## Your CV Is Not "Fine"

[JobStash](https://x.com/jobstash_xyz/status/2011349570488578444) dropped a thread that every job seeker needs to internalize: your CV is actively costing you interviews, and the fixes are straightforward.

In 2026, your resume passes through two filters: ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) and a human spending 6-8 seconds on initial screen. Fail either, and your skills don't matter.

## The ATS Filter

Modern ATS systems are more sophisticated than keyword matchers, but they're still dumb in predictable ways:

**Do:**
- Use standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Include exact keywords from the job description
- Use a single-column layout
- Submit as PDF with selectable text (not image-based)

**Don't:**
- Use tables, columns, or complex formatting
- Put critical info in headers/footers (many ATS skip these)
- Use creative job titles ("Code Wizard" → "Senior Software Engineer")
- Rely on graphics or icons for skills

## The Human Filter (6 Seconds)

After ATS, a human scans your CV for approximately 6 seconds. They're looking for:

1. **Current role + company** — Are you relevant?
2. **Impact metrics** — Did you move numbers?
3. **Tech stack match** — Can you do this specific job?

### Impact Over Responsibility

The single biggest upgrade: replace responsibility statements with impact statements.

❌ "Responsible for backend API development"
✅ "Rebuilt payment API, reducing latency from 800ms to 120ms and eliminating $2M/year in failed transactions"

Every bullet should follow: **[Action verb] + [What you did] + [Measurable result]**

## The 2026-Specific Playbook

### AI Skills Are Table Stakes Now
If you work with AI/ML, list specific models, frameworks, and workflows. "Experience with AI" means nothing. "Built RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex + GPT-4o, processing 10K documents/day" means everything.

### Show Agent Literacy
Companies hiring in 2026 want developers who can work *with* AI agents, not just write prompts. Include:
- Agent orchestration experience
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Specific tools: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.

### Portfolio > Credentials
GitHub activity, blog posts, and open-source contributions carry more weight than ever. Link them prominently. A single well-documented project beats three bullet points.

## My Takeaway

I'm applying this to my own ryanlisse.com portfolio. The principles are the same whether it's a PDF resume or a personal site: lead with impact, be specific about your stack, and make it scannable. Nobody reads walls of text — on paper or on screen.
