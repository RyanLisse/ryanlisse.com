## Boring Wins

[Joseph Choi shared](https://x.com/JosephKChoi) a paywall design insight that should humble every copywriter and product designer: a plain "Continue" button beat creative, clever call-to-action copy by 111%.

Not 11%. One hundred and eleven percent.

## Why Simple Beats Clever

Creative CTAs ("Unlock Your Potential!", "Start Your Journey!", "Get Instant Access!") feel good to write. They feel *productive*. You're crafting language, thinking about psychology, choosing power words.

But they introduce cognitive friction. The user has to:
1. Read the CTA
2. Parse what it means
3. Evaluate whether the promise matches their expectation
4. Decide if they trust the framing

A "Continue" button requires:
1. Click to continue

That's it. The user already decided they want to proceed (they're at the paywall). The CTA's job isn't to convince — it's to not get in the way.

## The Design Principle

**When the user has already made a decision, reduce friction. Don't sell.**

This applies everywhere:
- **Checkout pages**: "Complete Order" > "Invest in Yourself"
- **Signup flows**: "Continue" > "Join the Revolution"
- **Upgrade prompts**: "Upgrade" > "Supercharge Your Workflow"

Clever copy is for the top of funnel where you're creating desire. At the conversion point, desire already exists. Your job is to make the action effortless.

## When Creativity Does Win

This isn't an argument against good copywriting. It's an argument for *appropriate* copywriting:

- **Landing pages**: Creative copy wins. You're building interest.
- **Email subject lines**: Creative wins. You're competing for attention.
- **Paywalls / Checkout**: Simple wins. You're removing friction.
- **Onboarding**: Somewhere in between. Guide without overselling.

## The Takeaway for Builders

Test your assumptions. The "obvious" best practice (write compelling CTAs!) was wrong by a factor of 2x. In product design, your intuitions are hypotheses, not facts. A/B test everything that matters.

And when in doubt, boring usually wins.
