## Overview

Caly is a macOS Calendar CLI tool and MCP server that enables natural language calendar management. Built on Apple's EventKit framework, it provides full access to calendars, events, and reminders. Just type `caly add "Meeting tomorrow at 3pm"` and it handles the rest.

### Architecture

## The Problem

Managing calendars from the terminal or through AI assistants requires robust tooling. Caly provides a clean interface for calendar operations, making it easy to automate scheduling and integrate with other tools.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Create events using natural language ("Meeting tomorrow at 3pm")
- **Multi-Calendar Support**: Work with all calendars synced to macOS
- **Event Management**: Create, update, delete, and query events
- **Availability Checking**: Find free slots and detect conflicts
- **Recurring Events**: Full support for recurring event patterns
- **MCP Server**: AI assistants can manage your calendar

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Native macOS application
- **EventKit**: Apple's calendar and reminders framework
- **MCP SDK**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **Natural Language Processing**: Date/time parsing from human input

## CLI Examples

```bash
# List today's events
caly today

# Create an event
caly add "Team standup tomorrow 9am-9:30am"

# Check availability
caly free --date tomorrow

# List calendars
caly calendars

# Delete an event
caly delete "Team standup"
```

## MCP Tools

- `calendar_list_events`: Query events with date range
- `calendar_create_event`: Create new calendar events
- `calendar_update_event`: Modify existing events
- `calendar_check_availability`: Find free time slots
- `calendar_list_calendars`: List available calendars

## Outcome

Caly streamlines calendar management for developers and power users, enabling automation and AI-assisted scheduling that respects your existing calendar workflow.
