## Overview

Briefly is an AI-powered daily briefing system that aggregates information from multiple sources—iMessage, WhatsApp, Gmail, Calendar, and Whoop—into concise, actionable briefings with optional voice output.

## The Problem

Modern life involves juggling information from countless sources. Important messages get buried, calendar events are forgotten, and staying on top of everything becomes overwhelming. Briefly solves this by creating a unified, intelligent briefing.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Pulls data from iMessage, WhatsApp, Gmail, Calendar, and Whoop fitness tracker
- **AI Summarization**: Uses LLMs to intelligently summarize and prioritize information
- **Voice Output**: ElevenLabs integration for natural-sounding audio briefings
- **Smart Prioritization**: Identifies urgent items and important updates
- **Daily Digest**: Configurable timing for morning or custom briefing schedules
- **MCP Server**: Full MCP integration for AI assistant access

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: Native macOS application
- **EventKit**: Apple Calendar and Reminders integration
- **ElevenLabs API**: High-quality text-to-speech synthesis
- **MCP SDK**: Model Context Protocol for AI tool integration
- **Various APIs**: Gmail, WhatsApp, Whoop integrations

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches recent messages, emails, calendar events, and health metrics
2. **Intelligent Filtering**: Removes noise and identifies important items
3. **AI Processing**: LLM generates a coherent, prioritized summary
4. **Audio Generation**: Optional voice synthesis for hands-free consumption
5. **Delivery**: Briefing available via CLI, TUI, or voice

## Outcome

Briefly transforms chaotic information streams into a calm, organized start to the day. Users report feeling more in control and less likely to miss important items.
